# JAPCproxychecker
## JAPC - Just Another Proxy Checker

This was originally part of another project of mine that I slammed together quickly, but since I might need to use a proxy checker more often (and also because I didn't want this in the same directory as my other project) I decided to move it here. 

This works and is relatively intuitive to use now but I have to update the README for the usage
